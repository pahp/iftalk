# iftalk
Bash script emulating an interactive fiction interpreter for a talk. I wrote this script in about two hours because I figured it would be faster for me to do this than to learn Inform or some other system. It's not a good parser.

The script 'iftalk' (which must be executable) pretends to be an interactive fiction interpreter, when it is really a simple demonstration of IF-like behavior wrapped around some slides, a video, and an opportunity to demostrate / play Zork with the audience.

You'll need `ZORK1.DAT` and `jzip` (not included). The video demonstrating Text Fiction on Android is online and linked (although it can be pre-downloaded if desired -- see source for URL).

Code released under the GPLv3 (or later) and video released under CC.
